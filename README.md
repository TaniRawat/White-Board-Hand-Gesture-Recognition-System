Abstract:
The integration of hand gesture recognition systems into whiteboard applications represents a significant advancement in online study and collaboration. Traditional methods of interacting with whiteboards, such as using a mouse or keyboard, can sometimes feel cumbersome and disconnected. However, by harnessing the power of hand gestures, users can now interact with digital whiteboards in a more natural and intuitive manner.

Our proposed system leverages state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to detect and recognize a wide range of hand gestures. This includes common actions such as drawing, erasing, selecting objects, and even resizing them. Through extensive testing and evaluation using a diverse dataset of hand gesture videos, we have demonstrated that our system achieves high accuracy and robustness, making it suitable for practical applications.

In the context of education, the integration of hand gesture recognition into whiteboard applications has transformative potential. It allows teachers to engage with their students in a more dynamic and interactive way. By facing the students while teaching and using hand gestures to manipulate the content on the whiteboard, teachers can maintain better eye contact and connection with their students. This fosters a more engaging and immersive learning experience, ultimately leading to improved comprehension and retention of lesson content.

Furthermore, our system enhances collaboration by enabling seamless interaction among multiple users. Students can actively participate in discussions, collaborate on group projects, and provide real-time feedback using hand gestures. This promotes a sense of involvement and ownership in the learning process, facilitating better knowledge sharing and peer-to-peer interaction.
