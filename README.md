# Hand Gesture Recognition Based Interactive Whiteboard System

## 📌 Overview
The Hand Gesture Recognition Based Interactive Whiteboard System is an AI-powered application designed to enhance online education and collaboration by enabling natural, touch-free interaction with digital whiteboards. Instead of relying on traditional input devices like a mouse or keyboard, users can control the whiteboard using intuitive hand gestures, creating a more immersive and engaging experience.

This system leverages deep learning–based computer vision techniques to accurately detect and recognize hand gestures in real time, allowing users to draw, erase, select, resize, and manipulate objects seamlessly.
